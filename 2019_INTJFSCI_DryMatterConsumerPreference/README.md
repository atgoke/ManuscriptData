## Abstract
Dry matter is increasingly recognised as a reliable indicator of fruit quality and consumer acceptance for numerous commodities. To establish dry matter as an at-harvest metric predictive of post-storage andripening consumer acceptance in pear, cv. d’Anjou fruits were segregated into low (<13%), moderate (13–15.99%) and high (≥16%) predicted dry matter classifications at harvest using near-infrared spectroscopy and evaluated by untrained consumer panels following cold storage and ripening. Consumers significantly favoured higher dry matter fruits over lower dry matter fruits in terms of perceived firmness, crunchiness, juiciness, sweetness, flavour and overall liking. Consumers were willing to pay premium prices for higher dry matter fruits at an estimated $0.20/lb above average retail prices. Sorting fruit by dry matter at harvest via near-infrared spectroscopy may overcome issues of variation in fruit maturity and quality to produce more consistent consumer experiences in pears following post-storage ripening.
